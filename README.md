# spell-checker

- the program will use a file to create the corpus
- It will take any text file as input and check spelling on this file. and it will output a new file with typos corrected. The output file name will be the input file name with the word "_fixed" added to it.


# - The program will give the user one or more suggestions of what the word should actually be, along with the word he thinks is erroneous.  
# - By accepting one of the suggestions, the user should be able to replace the incorrect word in the original text with this suggested word.
# - Instead of ignoring or accepting one of the suggestions, the user should be able to enter the corrected version instead of the word considered to be incorrect.
 - If the word the user entered is not already in the corpus, it will update and enlarge your corpus with new words the user has entered.
